# Tile

**Tile** is a game written in plain JavaScript.

It was written as part of a University assignment a while ago.

[You can try it here](http://crdx.github.com/Tile). 

* Any options that differ from the defaults will be placed in the URL, so hotlinking to puzzle configurations is possible. 
* The Image URL can be any image, relative or absolute. [Like this](http://crdx.github.com/Tile/?gridWidth=8&gridHeight=8&imageUrl=https://raw.github.com/crdx/Tile/master/static/thing.jpg).
* [An animated GIF works, too](http://crdx.github.com/Tile/?gridWidth=8&imageUrl=https://raw.github.com/crdx/Tile/master/static/anim.gif).
